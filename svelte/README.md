# Svelte + TS + Vite + `wuchale`

This template should help get you started developing with Svelte and TypeScript in Vite with `wuchale`.

It is directly made from:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

And selecting `svelte` with TypeScript.

If you get an error on the first `npm run dev` after installing, you can kill the dev server and start again.
